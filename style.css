/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Unfortunately WordPress requires a style.css file
  located in the theme's root folder for the theme to work.
  However, we use Sass, not vanilla CSS to write our styles.
  These are located in the theme assets folder.
  For more understand of how Sass is compilled to CSS.
  Read the README.md file, which explains this more in detail.
